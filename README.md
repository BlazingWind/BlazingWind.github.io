 I am a security researcher at GitHub, where I find and disclose vulnerabilities in open source software, and publish my research as advisories and blog posts.

 Check out some of my blog posts:
 - [CodeQL zero to hero part 1: the fundamentals of static analysis for vulnerability research](https://github.blog/2023-03-31-codeql-zero-to-hero-part-1-the-fundamentals-of-static-analysis-for-vulnerability-research/). Link to the [challenges accompanying the blog post](https://github.com/sylwia-budzynska/codeql-zero-to-hero/tree/main/1)
 - [CodeQL zero to hero part 2: getting started with CodeQL](https://github.blog/2023-06-15-codeql-zero-to-hero-part-2-getting-started-with-codeql/). Link to the [challenges accompanying the blog post](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/codeql-zero-to-hero/tree/main/2)

Most of my advisories are published on GitHub Security Lab's website, together with other great researchers from GitHub. Check out our work at [securitylab.github.com/advisories](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/).
